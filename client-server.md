# Client-Server Architecture

The client-server architecture is a computing model that separates the application's concerns into two distinct roles: the client and the server. These roles communicate over a network to fulfill their respective functions.

# Components Includes:

# 1.Client

- In a client-server architecture, the "client" is like a customer or a service requester. It's the part of the system that you, as a user, interact with directly.
- The client sends requests for information or services to the server.

# 2.Server

- the "server" in a client-server architecture is like a helpful assistant that provides resources or services to your computer, smartphone, or other devices (the clients).
- It's like a central hub that holds and manages important information, files, or services.
- When your device (the client) needs something—like a webpage, file, or data—it asks the server for it.

# 3.Communication

- Communication between clients and servers occurs through a network, often the internet.
- Clients send requests to servers, and servers respond to those requests.
- Communication is typically facilitated through standard protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS in web applications.

# Benefits:

- **Scalability:** The client-server architecture allows for scalable systems where multiple clients can connect to a single server or a group of servers.
- **Centralized Management:** Servers provide a centralized point for managing resources, security, and data, simplifying maintenance.

# Conclusion:

The client-server architecture is a fundamental model in distributed computing, providing a scalable and modular approach to building applications. Its versatility has made it a prevalent choice for various types of systems, from simple web applications to complex enterprise solutions.
