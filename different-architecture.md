# Different Architectural Types

There are various architectural types in software development, each with its unique characteristics and differences. Here's a brief overview:

## 1. Monolithic Architecture

- **Characteristics:**

  - Single-tier structure where all components are tightly integrated.
  - Simple to develop and deploy.

- **Differences:**
  - **Pros:** Easier to manage and deploy.
  - **Cons:** Scaling can be challenging.

## 2. Client-Server Architecture

- **Characteristics:**

  - Two-tier structure with clients making requests and servers providing resources or services.
  - Enables efficient resource management.

- **Differences:**
  - **Pros:** Scalable and allows for centralized management.
  - **Cons:** Reliability depends on server uptime.

## 3. Microservices Architecture

- **Characteristics:**

  - Application divided into small, independent services.
  - Each service handles a specific business capability.

- **Differences:**
  - **Pros:** Scalable, independent development, and deployment.
  - **Cons:** Complexity in managing multiple services.

## 4. Serverless Architecture

- **Characteristics:**

  - Application development without managing server infrastructure.
  - Functions executed in response to events or requests.

- **Differences:**

  - **Pros:**

    - No server management, reducing operational overhead.
    - Cost-efficient, as you pay only for actual resource usage.

  - **Cons:**
    - Limited execution time for functions.
    - May introduce latency in the cold start of functions.
    - Might not be suitable for all types of applications.
